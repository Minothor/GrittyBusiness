# GrittyBusiness
*Someone's got to do it*

## What is it?
GrittyBusiness is a basic plugin to allow Gravel, Sand and Dirt to be
renewable resources in a vanilla compatible way.

## Why?
Because exploring to find more beaches and mountains is an unfair burden
on servers, leading to ever bloating maps and ugly scars.

Since stone and cobble is an infinite resource, shouldn't the smaller
particulates be too?

## How?
### Gravel and Sand
Blow it up!

Gritty business adds a configurable chance for blocks affected by an explosion
to shatter into smaller particles:
* Cobble into Gravel (may drop flint instead)
* Gravel and Sandstone into Sand

All of this is configurable, down to which block turns into which other block
and at what chance.

### Sluices
Sometimes, breaking apart rock is all you need to find trace minerals trapped within.

A sluice will help wash the freed resources out of the grit. 

## What's Next?
* More configuration options
* Automatable Sluices
